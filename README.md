# Tatlƒ±mƒ±Getir (Getir Clone) üë©‚Äçüíª

This project is a clone of the Getir website, created using React. The website is designed to replicate the popular grocery delivery service's interface with modern web technologies. Below is a brief overview of the project, its features, and how to get started.

## Features 

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, making it mobile-friendly.
- **React Components**: Built with reusable React components for maintainable and scalable code.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Faithful recreation of Getir's user interface with smooth interactions and animations.
- **Product Catalog**: Interactive product browsing experience similar to the original Getir platform.
- **Shopping Cart Functionality**: Add and remove items from cart with real-time updates.
